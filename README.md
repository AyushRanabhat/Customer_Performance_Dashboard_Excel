## Overview
This project presents an Excel dashboard built on pre processed retail sales data sourced from my earlier data warehouse and EDA work. You get a simple view of customer behavior, spending patterns, and segment level performance.

## Features Used
• Pivot tables  
• Pivot charts  
• Slicers for country, first order year, gender, marital status, and activity flag  
• Cards for total customers, total sales, total orders, average order value, average monthly spend, CLV, and average quantity per order  
• Visuals for age segments, spending tiers, gender mix, CLV over lifespan, top customers, and yearly trends

Data was prepared in a previous ETL and EDA workflow.  
This repository focuses on the dashboard layer.
